You can quickly start recording, recording the state of motion in the form of dynamic.
Recording files need to give them a group and a title, so that you can find it better.
You can listen to it repeatedly and after recording.
If you think the recording is not satisfied, you can give it up or delete it in the list.
Recording is a quicker way to record things than to use pen or typewriting.
